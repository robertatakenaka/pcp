How to identify an issue
------------------------ 

================================  ======  ===============================================
label                             tag
--------------------------------  ------  -----------------------------------------------
volume                            31
supplement of volume              131
number                            32

sequential number                 36      YYYY + the order 
                                          of publication of the issue within the year.
                                          It is part of the PID of the issue and 
                                          it is the order in "All issues" of the website
================================  ======  ===============================================

    
Identifying regular issues
..........................

Fill in the volume and number fields.

The sequential number is the year followed by the order of the issue within the year. 
E.g.: 20101 (first issue within the year).

Identifying supplements
.......................

If there are supplements, fill in volume, number (if applicable), and the corresponding supplement fields. 
 
If the supplement is identified only with the label **Supplement**, fill in with 0, otherwise the label which identifies the supplement, for example, 1, A, etc.

On the website, in the "All issues" pages, if it is required the supplements be after all the regular issues within the year, the sequential numbers of the supplements must be greater than the last regular issue's sequential number.

E.g.: If there are 4 regular numbers in the year, then the order of the sequential number for the supplements starts from 5.

.. image:: img/titlemanager_issue_seq_number_for_supplement.jpg


Identifying ahead issues
........................

Fill in the **number** field the word ahead, for ahead issue. By convention the order of the sequential number is 50.

.. image:: img/titlemanager_issue_seq_number_for_ahead.jpg


Identifying press release issues
.................................

Fill in the same fields according to the rules above, plus **pr** in the complement field.
The sequential number is the year followed by the order of the issue within the year, but by **convention** starts in 100.

Problems with filling in the sequential number
----------------------------------------------

If the sequential number and the issue identification do not match, the program presents two situations:


1. Sequential number belongs to another issue

.. image:: img/titlemanager_issue_sequential_number_belongs_to_another_issue.jpg

Solution: 
    List the issues and select the issue


2. Mistake or replacement?

.. image:: img/titlemanager_issue_mistake_or_replacement.jpg

If the sequential number and the issue identification do not match, but the `sequential number <concepts.html#sequential-number>`_ **DOES NOT BELONG TO** another issue, the program will ask to:

- open the issue, with the corrected sequential number
- change the sequential number, as informed 

    .. warning::

        The sequential number is part of the PID. 
        It must not be changed if the issue is already published on the website.
        The program does not know if the issue is already published or not.
